2. **Simple over complex** - MVP mindset always
3. **Stability over features** - Working product > new features
4. **Customer-driven** - Build what users actually need

### Timeline Flexibility
- **Delays expected** - Life happens, adjust accordingly
- **Quality over speed** - Better late than broken
- **Iteration preferred** - Ship small, improve constantly
- **Revenue gates features** - Can't build what can't afford
